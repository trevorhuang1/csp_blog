## My Scores

- Above are my scores for all three practice MCQs in chronological order of when I took them
- I scored 69/70 on the the 2021 MCQ Reflection
- Huge jump from last trimester 

## Extra Credit
- I went over the first 3 most missed questions for the 2020 MCQ and gave hints for popcorn hacks

## Test Corrections

- In this problem I confused parallel computing with sequencial computing and mistakenly picked 3
- Parallel computing is performing multiple tasks simultaneously
- Sequential computing is executing one task after the other
- **The correct answer is A, because parallel computing does several tasks at once so if the problem is sequential then parallel computing cannot do it properly**

## Questions I was unsure about

- This was basically an educated guess by me
- The reason is because of open protocols, which allow new users to join networks more easily

- I almost got this one wrong because I didn't see the move forward in between calling the function
- I think I just need to be more careful and skim over the possible answers before I look at the problem

## Reflection
- I have been noticing improvement in my coding skills and this MCQ solidified it
    - Between now and towards the start of second trimester, my scores increased the most which makes sense based on how much programming I was doing last trimester
    - The team teaches helped a lot as well
- The only problem I got wrong was a concept I hadn't reviewed in a while, so if I decide to prep for the next MC I think getting a full score is possible
- Overall, I'm very happy with how I've done so far and I want to continue improving all aspects of being an engineering
    - This is yet another step in the right direction and I hope to see more progression like this in the future
