## Glows
- A lot of people were interested in our game!
    - Across all ages, from kids to even software engineers
- Even some professionals had complements about our project
- All features were working

## Grows
- The leaderboard and the trading was not very well integrated within the project
- The items need to be more uniform and idenitfiable
- For many it was difficult to discover recipes
- We need to work on our presentation skills and not crowd around the people who 

## Feedback --> Revise
- Instead of seperate pages, I plan to make the leaderboard and trading a popup within the baking page so that the player no longer needs to constantly click around
- Possibly get all of the food images from one source so they have a common look 
- My goal is to add on to the friends page and not only have trading, but also a encyclopedia of the items that the person already has made
    - Also, maybe a hint system to get beginners going

- This was a cool CSA project that I saw (jinder??) which used algorithmns, frontend/backend, and also had an interviewing page. I was interested when they were discussining how they were using the algorithmn to account for differences between workers given favorable skill sets for but slightly different other factors

## Something cool I saw outside of CS

- I checked out my friend Deva's 3D Animation Project with some friends and I was impressed by the aesthetic look of the coffee shop they created using Blender
