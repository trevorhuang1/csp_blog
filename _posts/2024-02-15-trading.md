- There is now backend logic for sending/accepting friend requests
- I tested with Postman and it was adding to the database
- Some next steps are:
    - Add code logic for accepting/denying friend requests
    - Pull request to main so that Hanlun and Matthew can help me out
- <a href="https://github.com/trevorhuang1/lmc-frontend/commit/af0e4549025f89f7fe2de8e952acc9c4bf8074bb">Link to frontend commit</a>
- Solid progress, but I need to make it more appealing as it turns out drop down menus are not that good looking
