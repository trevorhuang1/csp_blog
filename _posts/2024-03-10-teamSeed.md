## Roles
- Matthew: Model work(backend)
- Trevor: API and model management(frontend)

## Integration
- Working on our individually cloned repos, then via daily-standups every other day we share our progress to keep each other updated. Our weekly goals will involve integrating each others progress into our individual CPT projects, dissecting each other's code, practicing good commenting habits, pull requests, and consistent github issues/blogs to make it easy to track and integrate each others features. 

## Specifics(last tri features)
- Trevor: Friend request trading system. 
- Matthew: Baking and Drag/Dropping system

## Function
- We will be using a kaggle data set of pre-existing recipes <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/recipenlg">Link</a>
- On frontend, user selects certain parameters for what kind of recipe they want to introduce into the game
- Model on the backend will predict the best recipe to add to the game based on the items the current user has and the dataset
- Both members worked on the same project last trimester
